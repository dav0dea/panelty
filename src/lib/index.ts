/**
 * panelty — a tab + panel workspace for Svelte.
 *
 * Three components compose: `<Tabs>` alone is a tab strip, `<Panels>` alone is a splittable panel
 * tree, and `<Panels>` inside `<Tabs>` is a workspace — the cross-boundary drags exist there and are
 * UNEXPRESSIBLE anywhere else, because the drag bus one publishes is what the other looks for.
 *
 * The package holds no tree and writes nothing. It draws the arrangement it is handed, recognises
 * the gestures over it, and raises each one through a [`LayoutHost`] — so whoever implements that
 * owns persistence, concurrency, undo and what a tab is CALLED. The panels themselves are the
 * consumer's too: `registerPanel` takes a component and an id, and nothing in here knows what any
 * of them draw.
 *
 * Styling is a namespaced custom-property contract — import `panelty/tokens.css` for the look it
 * ships with, then override `--panelty-*` to wear your own. See that file.
