/**
 * The seam between the panel system and whatever owns the arrangement.
 *
 * The panel system holds no tree. It draws the one it is handed (`syncFromDoc`), recognises the
 * gestures over it, and raises each one HERE — as an intent, not as a write. Whoever implements
 * this owns persistence, concurrency, undo and the naming of tabs — a networked implementation
 * turns each call into one command on the wire; [`memoryHost`] plans it over a tree in memory.
 *
 * **Two contracts, each naming only what its own component can trigger.** A consumer rendering the
 * tab strip alone is never handed a method about panels, and a consumer rendering one tab's panels
 * alone is never handed a method about tabs. Neither has an optional member: the one gesture that
 * spans both halves is named in the vocabulary of a MOVE rather than by a method that may be
 * missing — see [`Landing`].
 *
 * Every write answers whether it LANDED. A refusal is ordinary — closing a tab's last panel, a
 * peer having already taken what this gesture names — and the panel system uses the answer to
 * decide where to move the focus, never to retry. An op that MINTS answers ids instead, because the
 * caller has no other handle on what it made; a move never does, because the caller named the
 * subtree and the next tree it is handed says where the subtree went.
