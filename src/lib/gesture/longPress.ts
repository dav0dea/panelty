/**
 * Long-press recognition — the coarse-pointer door onto a command that a fine pointer reaches by
 * double-click, chord or right-click. A canvas uses it for "add something here", which on touch
 * has no other pointer route.
 *
 * A press fires once it has been held for `HOLD_MS` within `MOVE_TOLERANCE_PX` of where it landed;
 * anything that ends or moves the gesture disarms it, which is what keeps it clear of a pan (a
 * drag moves, a press does not). Distance is measured from the ORIGIN, so a slow walk across the
 * canvas cannot creep past the tolerance one sub-tolerance step at a time.
 *
 * Deliberately event-free: it takes points, not `PointerEvent`s, and never calls `preventDefault`
 * or `stopPropagation`. The gesture it watches therefore still reaches everything else listening
 * for it — SvelteFlow's pan, and `workspace/Panel.svelte`'s capture-phase `setActive`.
