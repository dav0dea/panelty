/**
 * `beginDrag` — the one pointer-drag lifecycle every drag handle here shares.
 *
 * Three of them (the panel corner grips, the split seam, the inspector's resize handle) each hand-
 * rolled the same `pointerdown → window move/up` pattern, and all three got the same thing wrong:
 * they detached on `pointerup` ALONE. A touch pointer is CANCELLED, not released, whenever the
 * browser reclaims the gesture — a pan takes over, a system gesture starts, a second finger lands —
 * so the listeners survived it, the preview ghost stayed painted, and the next release anywhere in
 * the app ran the leaked handler and committed the abandoned intent. For a corner grip that intent
 * is a `ws.split()` or a `ws.close()`: an abandoned gesture restructuring the workspace one tap
 * later. `ui/NumberInput.svelte` was the only handler in the tree that already got this right;
 * this is its shape, extracted so the three cannot drift apart again.
 *
 * The pointer is CAPTURED rather than the window listened to, which is the other half of the same
 * correctness: capture guarantees the resolution lands on the element that started the gesture even
 * when the pointer has left it — including a mouse released outside the window, where a window
 * listener hears nothing at all.
 *
 * Pure enough to unit-test without a DOM: a real `HTMLElement` satisfies `DragPointerTarget`
 * structurally, and nothing here reads the document.
