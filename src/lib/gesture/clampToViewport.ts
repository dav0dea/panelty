 * `clampToViewport` — the one correct anchored-overlay clamp, the SSOT every anchored
 * overlay positions against. Lifted verbatim from `ContextMenu.svelte`'s measured
 * viewport math and generalised from a spawn point to an anchor rect: a popover opens flush under the
 * anchor's bottom-left, then shifts back on-screen — never past a small viewport `MARGIN` on ANY
 * edge — if it would overflow. A point anchor is just the degenerate rect
 * (`left == right`, `top == bottom`, zero-sized), which is how ContextMenu spends it. Pure, so it is
 * unit-tested without a DOM (the component just feeds it real `getBoundingClientRect()` measurements).
 *
 * The shift (not a flip) mirrors ContextMenu exactly; `Math.max(MARGIN, …)` floors an
 * overflowing/oversized menu to the margin so it is never pushed off-screen (never negative).
 * A caller whose anchor sits at the BOTTOM of the screen opts into `{ flip: true }` — see below.

 * a helper that reaches up into a store pulls that layer into the primitives' bundle chunk, and the
 * reshuffled CSS emission order costs the app a flash of unstyled chrome on first paint. The
 * published custom property is the seam; every overlay measures through this one function so they
 * cannot disagree — including one that does not clamp at all but places itself. The measurement
 * lives beside the pure clamp for that reason, and only that reason.
