/**
 * Progressive overflow — the measured half of a chrome strip that gives its actions up one at a
 * time.
 *
 * The app header's actions live in the bar and give themselves up to the overflow menu ONE AT A
 * TIME, lowest priority first, as the width runs out. That is not a breakpoint and it cannot be
 * written in CSS: "does item N still fit" is a question about intrinsic widths, which no media or
 * container query can ask. So the decision is arithmetic, and it lives here — pure, away from the
 * DOM, where it can be pinned by unit tests rather than by a screenshot.
 *
 * The one property that matters is that `planOverflow` is a function of its ARGUMENTS. Moving an
 * item out of the bar changes what is rendered, which re-fires the ResizeObserver that decided to
 * move it; if the plan read the bar's own content it would flip-flop forever at exactly the
 * boundary width. It reads cached intrinsic widths and a budget its caller measures off the OTHER
 * boxes in the header, so the second pass computes the first pass's answer and writes nothing.
 *
 * "The other boxes" is not "boxes that cannot move" — the status cluster shrinks (see TopBar's own
 * note), so the budget is re-measured rather than assumed constant. What makes it converge is that
 * the only growable box is the tab strip: a spilled action's width goes there 1:1, leaving the fit
 * condition a monotone threshold in the container width.

	 * menu holds the spilled actions and nothing else, so at a width where all of them fit there is
	 * no menu to open and drawing a `⋯` beside them would be a door onto an empty room.
	 *

/**
 * The ids that must move into the overflow menu, given the budget.
 *
 * `spillOrder` is the priority order LOWEST FIRST: the id named first is the first the bar gives
 * up. Ids it names that are not in `items` are ignored, so a caller may keep one constant order.
 *
 * `trigger` is charged whenever it is on screen — which for a RESIDENT menu is unconditionally,
 * because such a menu carries commands that have no bar slot to lose at any width. So there the
 * second trap — a trigger that appears and pushes the last item out — is designed away rather than
 * guarded against. A bar whose menu holds only the spilled items says
 * `residentTrigger: false`, and pays that trap with the property below instead.
 *
 * What survives either way is MONOTONICITY: the answer is the first prefix of `spillOrder` that
 * fits, and a prefix that fits at one budget still fits at a larger one — so a wider bar can never
 * spill more. That is the whole non-oscillation argument, and it does not depend on the trigger
 * being free.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT implementing the "never leave exactly one item in the overflow" hint: where the
 * first thing to spill is a split button's caret, losing it alone degrades cleanly — the control
 * becomes a plain button. Forcing its neighbour out alongside it would remove a reachable button to
 * satisfy a symmetry nobody sees.
