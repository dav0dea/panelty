/**
 * The package, driven standalone.
 *
 * A host that turns each gesture into a network command tests the APP behind it, and tests this
 * contract poorly: a port only proves itself against a second implementation. `memoryHost` is that
 * second one, and this drives it. No socket, no server, no app — the host owns the tree, the store
 * raises gestures at it, and what comes back is asserted as an arrangement rather than a payload.
 *
 * One scenario, in the order a person actually works: open a workspace, split it, give the halves
 * content, resize the seam, tear one off into a tab of its own, come back and close it.
