/**
 * Helpers for the opaque per-panel `state` blob.
 *
 * Panel `state` is an untyped bag persisted in the layout tree. Two conventions
 * ride on top of it that several panels — and the framework's node-link cleanup
 * — share, so they live here in one place instead of being re-derived per panel:
 *
 *  - it coerces to a plain object (`asStateObject`)
 *  - node-linked panels (Parameters / Viewer / Metadata) store the bound node's
 *    uid (its stable identity, not the display name) under `node`
 *    (`linkedNodeName` — the name is kept for compatibility)
 *  - a node editor stores its sub-patch depth under `subpatchPath`, encoded by
 *    `pathToArray` / `arrayToPath`
 *
 * Keeping these keys in one module means the model, the workspace store, and
 * every linkable panel agree on where each one lives.
